# odin-recipes
This is an HTML Project in which I'll make an html file for recipes of my choice. The skills I demonstrated here are using element tags such as, heading tags, p, divs, lists, images, connecting web pages together. I also added a little CSS to add a bit of life on the web pages and this is a project that I will continue to improve and work on in the future.
