Odin Recipes is a cookbook kind-of-website which features and lists down the meals I love to make the most. It contains the ingredients needed and the method in making the meals.

This is an HTML Project in which I'll make a website for recipes of my choice to reinforce my HTML skills and hone how I make the structure of a website. I also added a little CSS to add a bit of life on the web pages and this is a project that I will continue to improve and work on in the future.
